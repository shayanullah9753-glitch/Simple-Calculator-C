# SIMPLE CLI CALCULATOR

A lightweight, command line interface (CLI) calculator built using "C". This project demonstrates basic arithmetic logic, user input handling, and control flow structures in C programming.

**FEATURES:**

* Basic Arithmetic: Performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
* Error Handling: Includes checks for division by zero to prevent program crashes.
* User Friendly Interface: Clear prompts for inputting numbers and selecting operations.
* Looping Functionality: Allows users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

**BUILT WITH:**

* Language: C
* Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

**HOW TO RUN:**

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Simple-Calculator-C.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Simple-Calculator-C

3. Compile the code:
gcc "Simple Calculator.c" -o calculator

4. Run the executable:
./calculator

**WHAT I LEARNED:**

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

* Standard I/O functions ('printf' and 'scanf').
* Using 'switch-case' statements for efficient menu selection.
* Implementing conditional logic for error prevention.
* The compilation process of C programs.
